# tn-covid19-data

Gathering spot for machine-readable COVID-19 data for us in analysis of data.

* events.csv contains the events as they happened on a county level
* countylist is the list of counties that match the spelling and capitalization of the data that is published daily by the TN Department of Health.

The intent is to provide verifiable sources in the events. The initial pass was just to get things set up initially. Subsequent additions should have URLs that document the source of the information.
